        2.Adding the attribute: [HttpGet]
        when we type Http => VS IDE will give us the type of the HTTP request 
        which is "Get" in our case
        

        NOTES:
        ======
        1. Notice that the attribute [HttpGet] in this example is optional!
        Because WEB API supports naming convention,
        since our method name is Get or starts with Get
        and we only have one "Get" method in this controller
        ASP will assume that we are using HTTP Get Request
        
        2. We are using the class "Product" => <Product>
        so we need to import (using) it from the Models folder:
        VS IDE will suggest: using CoolCrafts.WebSite.Models;

        /*
        IMPORTANT NOTE:
        ===============
        Problem:
        In case if you have more than one get method and all have this attribute:
        [HttpGet]
        You will receive an error as ASP will be confused which method to call
        for the HTTP Get Request?

        Solution:
        We need to add the routing url string.

        Solution Examples:
        1. In one line:
        [HttpGet("GetAllUsers")]
        
        2. In two lines:
        [HttpGet]
        [Route("GetAllUsers"]
