CoolCrafts: ASP.NET Core Web Application Quick Demo

Creating a simple ASP.NET Core Web Application to get an idea about the main components of the application and learning about getting the data from a JSON file. 

This application was built based on the ASP.NET Core tutorial "ContosoCrafts" from Microsoft but it has been fully updated based on the new Visual Studio 2022 and the .NET 7 instead of using Visual Studio 2019 with the old .NET versions.

This repo will be a quick demo about using ASP.NET Core, JSON API, and Azure Publishing.

**Please refer to my PDF file "ASP.NETCore-CoolCrafts" for more details and explications about each step in this repo.**
